I willl choose one of my favourite movie *BLACK SWAN* to create
a interactive movie poster. *BLACK SWAN* is a psychological thriller that explores the intense and competitive world of ballet. The story happens around Nina Sayers, a talented but fragile ballet dancer, as she prepares for the lead role in "Swan Lake." The film delves into her psychological descent into madness and her transformation into the Black Swan character since she really want to be PERFECT to play that role.

**Ideas and sketches**
-size: I want a regular poster size 12 x 18
-I will use pictures as metapher of the main idea of the movie,that is the transition from white swan to black swan.
-I will use visual elements, animation, and interactivity to convey the psychological tension and transformation.
-I may create the poster both interactive with mouseclick and time based
-The poster will feature a central image of Nina Sayers (or just swan images) that will gradually transform from the White Swan to the Black Swan over time.

- Mouse click movements will allow users to interact with the poster. When the user hovers over specific areas, it will trigger animations or reveal hidden elements like some words from the movie that symbolize key scenes or themes from the movie.

# Mid-term Milestone 2 
This week I want to finish the graphic drawing part with the time effect
and do the mouse click part for next
Nina and swan in simple parts?
So I was thinking of using some abstract shapes to form silhouettes of these two characters

My images will all take place in one poster, and I finally decided to change the swan  
so that the swan on the left will turn black when you put your mouse over that swan (mouse hover)
I Gave up the 12*18 size but use a window screen instead (since the 12*18 size look weird)

First of all this week I was thinking about the effect of my mouse hover triggering the black swan, but I just drew a rough model of the swan and I wasn't very happy with it, I need this week to make the swan look a bit better. (or I will just use time controls the swan and use hover to reveal the words from the posters,not sure..)

I thought about if I need to draw my own swan, then I need the custom function of drawSwan. I started with a base like beginShape(), but I'd like to learn a bit more about drawing arcs in some way (I'm still learning)

So I ended up coming up with this based on our Week 3 Boolean Mouseover tutorial, where my mouse fills in black when it hovers over the swan on the left. I'm also using a custom drawSwan function. next I'm going to think about how to make it look better and if I need to use my previous idea, I'm not sure if the hover effect is interesting or the click effect better works, or time controls. but if I want to make the user interact with the screen so that when they click or hover, a special line will be displayed, I'm going to use text effect that I've been thinking about this week. I'll use some text animation to do this hover or click effect.like i=0,i < text. width, i++, or something

THINGS NEED TO IMPROVE:
I don't think I'm getting a handle on this beginShape（）, I'm having a hard time getting a handle on the coordinates and sequencing of the vertex. This is something I need to practice
Still I TRIED but I feel like the swans are just ugly, but no idea how to improve.I was just thinking some abstract shapes

Still i don‘t know how to pull up fonts, so im considering design my only font for the title "black swan" and save as a png, then add a picture inside.
this "blackswan" will just always remains without interactions
i did several sketches for my design. I will figure out which design visually looks cool. but any suggestions appreciated

Or the sudden idea during class07,what if I draw white swan images and then loadImage
then the left swan will just change into a black swan(just cover the orignial swan during the amount of time)
